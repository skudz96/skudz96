## Hi there 👋

I'm an aspiring web developer currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp focused on web development. I'm passionate about learning modern technologies and building web applications that make a difference. Here’s a little more about me:

🔭 Currently learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React
🌱 Looking forward to: Deepening my knowledge in front-end and back-end development, with an eye on full-stack development
💡 Skills: Responsive design, problem-solving, version control (Git/GitHub), teamwork, and an eagerness to keep learning
🚀 Projects I'm working on: Building web applications as part of my bootcamp, and experimenting with personal projects that solve real-world problems
🤝 Open to collaborating on: Open-source projects, hackathons, and any opportunity to build exciting things
🌍 Outside of coding: I'm interested in gaming, mental health advocacy, and always up for a good conversation about how technology can impact lives
Feel free to check out my repositories and follow my coding journey!
